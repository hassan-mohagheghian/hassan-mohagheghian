## Hi there 👋

I'm a software engineer with 8+ years of experience, specializing in backend development.  
Previously worked as a full-stack engineer, I progressed step by step in both **programming** and **product development**:

- In programming: from writing simple functions to designing scalable architectures and applying design patterns.  
- In product development: collaborated on projects across IT and retail domains, from small to large-scale products.

**Technologies:** Python (Django, FastAPI), JavaScript, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes.  
Currently deepening expertise in backend and data layers, exploring Rust, and building scalable web systems.
